#+title: Readme


A new prolog inspired shell, written in [[https://github.com/mthom/scryer-prolog][Scryer Prolog]] .


OK, making a tui is too painful, I'm changin the direction of this. I don'rt know somebody fix this for me pls.

* How to Run


With the power of Nix, you can run it immediatly from the terminal.

#+begin_src bash
nix run github:jzw2/piscis
#+end_src

*Please note that it currently only works on MacOS*

* Syntax
** Variables
I will steal the variables of bash (still wonderig if this is a good idea, since it does kind of look ugly), and variables will be prefixed with a dollar sign.

#+begin_src
ls $x, echo $x
#+end_src

** No paretheses

Because I hate parentheses, they will be optional.

#+begin_src
ls $x, isPython $x, echo $x
#+end_src


Note this means that you lose the homoiconicity of prolog.
